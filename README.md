LOGISTICS PROJECT:

Problem description:
An online store has a depot from which items purchased by customers are packed into vehicles and delivered to the respective customers. 
The first part of the problem - allocating items to vehicles is a bin packing problem (BPP). 
The second part of the problem - delivering items is a travelling salesman proble (TSP).

As part of my honours project research, I will be looking at various exact and metaheurastic techniques to implement to solve the problem.

All efforts displayed here are based on research findings from various authors as well as my two supervisors of the project. 

The Jupyter noteboks are the implementations, using the sample input data provided by the .csv  files.
